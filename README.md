# CIFAR-10 Classification with Albumentations and Depthwise Separable Convolutions

This repository provides code implementation for training a CIFAR-10 image classifier using Albumentations for Data augmentation and Depthwise separable convolutions in PyTorch.

## Albumentations:

Albumentations is a popular Python library for image augmentation in machine learning and computer vision tasks. It provides a wide range of transformation techniques, such as random cropping, rotations, flips, color adjustments, and many more. Albumentations is designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications and large-scale datasets.

Using Albumentations, we can easily apply complex augmentations to our training dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize and handle various real-world scenarios.

## Depthwise Separable Convolutions:

Depthwise separable convolutions are a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) operation that aims to reduce the computational complexity and model size while maintaining or improving performance. It achieves this by decomposing the standard convolution into two separate operations: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution.
